#integrity_config
  %h1
    %span Configuring Integrity
  
  %p
    Fortunately it's simple to configure. You only need to touch one file:
  
  %code.shell
    %pre /path/to/integrity/config.yml
  
  %p
    Even better: the sample file generated by <code>integrity install</code> 
    explains all the possible options. In case you want to see them anyway,
    %a{ :href => "http://github.com/foca/integrity/tree/master/config/config.sample.yml" } you can see the source file
    at GitHub.
  
#notifiers
  %h1
    %span Configuring the Notifiers
  
  %p
    As explained in
    %a{ :href => "/notifiers" } the notifiers page
    all you need to do to get them working after installing them is require them
    in the <code>config.ru</code> file generated by <code>integrity install</code>.
  
  %p
    Once required there, you need to restart the app, and each notifier can be 
    configured on a per-project basis by browsing to the project and clicking on
    the <em>edit</em> link
