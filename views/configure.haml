#integrity_config
  %h1
    %span Configuring Integrity
  
  %p
    Fortunately it's simple to configure. You only need to touch one file:
  
  %pre
    %code.shell< /path/to/integrity/config.yml
  
  %p
    Even better: the sample file generated by <code>integrity install</code> 
    explains all the possible options. In case you want to see them anyway,
    %a{ :href => "http://github.com/foca/integrity/tree/master/config/config.sample.yml" } you can see the source file
    at GitHub.
  
#notifiers
  %h1
    %span Configuring the Notifiers
  
  %p
    As explained in
    %a{ :href => "/notifiers" } the notifiers page
    all you need to do to get them working after installing them is require them
    in the <code>config.ru</code> file generated by <code>integrity install</code>.
  
  %p
    Once required there, you need to restart the app, and each notifier can be 
    configured on a per-project basis by browsing to the project and clicking on
    the <em>edit</em> link

#deployment_options
  %h1
    %span Deployment options
  
  %p
    Our preferred environment for running integrity is
    %a{ :href => "http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/" } thin
    +
    = succeed "." do
      %a{ :href => "http://nginx.net/" } nginx
    
  %p
    To this end, integrity ships a <code>thin.yml</code> ready to be used.
    After doing <code>integrity install /a/b/c</code> you should run:
  
  %pre 
    %code.shell<
      :preserve
        $ thin -C /a/b/c/thin.yml -R /a/b/c/config.ru start   # to start it
        $ thin -C /a/b/c/thin.yml -R /a/b/c/config.ru restart # to restart it
        $ thin -C /a/b/c/thin.yml -R /a/b/c/config.ru stop    # to stop it
  
  %p
    To proxy the web calls to thin we use nginx, with the following configuration:
    
  %pre
    %code.conf<
      :preserve
        upstream builder-integrityapp-com {
          server 127.0.0.1:8910;
          server 127.0.0.1:8911;
        }
      
        server {
          server_name builder.integrityapp.com;
          location / {
            proxy_pass http://builder-integrityapp-com;
          }
        }
  
  %p
    If you run Integrity behind apache + thin, or Passenger, or other deployment
    strategy, drop us a line at
    %a{ :href => "mailto:info@integrityapp.com" } info@integrityapp.com
    and let us know what config worked for you so we can include it here :-)
