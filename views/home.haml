  %p 
    Integrity is the angel watching over your shoulder while you code. As soon as you push your commits,
    it builds, runs your tests, and makes sure everything runs fine.
  %p 
    It then 
    %a{ :href => "/notifiers" } reports the build status 
    back to your team so everyone's on the same page, and if there's a problem, you can get it fixed right 
    away.

  %p
    %strong It's ridiculously easy. 
    All you need is to have <tt>ruby</tt> and <tt>rubygems</tt> installed on your server, and then do this:
  
  %code.shell
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
        $ sudo gem install foca-integrity
        $ integrity install /path/to/my/app

  %p
    This will create a couple files on your server, mainly <tt>config.yml</tt>, <tt>config.ru</tt> and
    <tt>thin.yml</tt>.
  
  %p 
    After 
    %a{ :href => "/configure" } editing those config files 
    to your needs, just do this:
  
  %code.shell
    %pre
      :preserve
        $ sudo gem install thin
        $ thin -C /path/to/my/app/thin.yml -R /path/to/my/app/config.ru start
  
  %p
    Finally, point your web server (nginx, apache, or whatever you like) to proxy requests made to your
    integrity domain to the previous configuration. 

  %p 
    After reloading your webserver's config, you should be gold. Just browse to your
    new Integrity install and add your first project!

  %p
    Short answer:
    %strong Yeah!
  
  %p
    Slightly longer answer: as long as your build process can be run from an unix-y 
    environment <strong>and</strong> it returns a <em>zero</em> status code for
    success and <em>non-zero</em> for failure, then integrity works for you.
